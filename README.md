## Description

This application lets the user write, save, recall, and delete notes on a webpage. The server persists data as it updates through user interaction. 

This repository was cloned from code provided by The University of Texas at Austin, for use in their Code Bootcamp - Web Development coursework. All front-end code was provided for the assignment. All server-side code was written by Stephen Trudell.
